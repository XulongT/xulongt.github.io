# 🐲 About Xulong
Hello! I'm Xulong Tang, you can call me Ben!

I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. My research is primarily advised by **Professor [Rawan Alghofaili](https://rawanmg.com/)** and co-advised by **Professor [Balakrishnan Prabhakaran](https://www.albany.edu/ai-plus/faculty/balakrishnan-prabha-prabhakaran)**.


**Research Interests**: 
- 3D Human Dance Motion Generation
- Extended Reality (XR), including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality
- Computer Vision
- Multimedia Retrieval
- Multimodal Learning

In addition to my research, I am also a game developer:

I have used Unity to create a VR educational game for teaching children about the universe at the [Sci-Tech Discovery Center](https://mindstretchingfun.org/). 

I have also contributed to the development of an unreleased third-person survival shooter game using Unreal Engine and C++, where I was responsible for gameplay and user interface.
