# 🐲 About Xulong
Hello! I'm Xulong Tang, you can call me Ben!

I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas.

**Research Interests**: 
- Extended Reality (XR), including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality
- Computer Vision
- Multimedia Retrieval
- Multimodal Learning

In addition to my research, I am also a game developer:

I have used Unity to create a VR educational game for teaching children about the universe at the [Sci-Tech Discovery Center](https://mindstretchingfun.org/). 

I have also contributed to the development of an unreleased third-person survival shooter game using Unreal Engine and C++, where I was responsible for gameplay and user interface.
